Where am I?


Unfortunately, I tried many times to upload my files through git in command line, however there was always an error that read 

"Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
  (commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)

        modified:   Tabs (modified content)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")"

I have tried deleting my repository and creating it again but for some reason for both instances, the folder "Tabs" cannot be clicked.

Therefore, I have uploaded my files onto Google Drive.

I have also tried uploading another method using Github desktop and there was no luck.
